# Quantum-Computing---Grover-s-Algorithm
Grover's Algorithm fo 2, 3, 4 qubits

Here is a folder where you can find the Grover's algorithm implementation for 2, 3, 4 qubits. Please, for the real device's simulation, mind if the token doesn't work, connect with yourself with your account on IBM and replace it by your account's token.

You might found more about the explanantion of this implementation on :
